<h2>Driver Behavior Modeling with Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<table style="border-width: 0; margin-bottom: 10px">

      <p style="text-align: justify">We propose an actor-critic method - Attention-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (ATD3) algorithm to approximate a driver's action according to observations and measure the driver's attention allocation for consecutive time steps in car-following model. Considering reaction time, we construct the attention mechanism in the actor network to capture temporal dependencies of consecutive observations. In the critic network, we employ Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) to address overestimated value estimates persisting in the actor-critic algorithm.</p>
