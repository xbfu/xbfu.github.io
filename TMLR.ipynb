    "- W1: Not enough examples supporting that new problem formulation should be explored. In my opinion, when one proposes a new problem/field/etc. that should be explored, he/she should give many examples of where this problem appears, so that the community has a clear understanding of why this new area/field should be explored.\n",

    "- W2: In the current version, graphless clients perform more work than the clients who own graph structures. Therefore, clients who have local graph structures will stay without any jobs for some time. In my opinion, this is a waste of resources. I would suggest performing graph learning on the clients with local graph structures and forcing the output to be close to ground truth local graph structure. This knowledge can also be used by graphless clients to further improve their graph learners.\n",

    "- Q1: In the example of Figure 1, it seems new banks who don’t have transaction history are also not able to construct proper node features as well, i.e. $\\textbf{X}^{(k)}$  seems to be unreliable as well. For example, node features should contain features like average money transferred/spent which cannot be known without transaction history. In other words, it feels like if a client doesn’t have $\\textbf{A}^{(k)}$, then it also doesn’t have good $\\textbf{X}^{(k)}$, and one should use node feature learner as well.\n",

It is a minor comment, but I think it could help to position better the paper and to make it easier for the average reader.\n",
