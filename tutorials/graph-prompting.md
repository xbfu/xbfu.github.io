## Abstract
<p style="text-align: justify">
Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world scenarios.
As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks.
During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged.
This tutorial will conver recent advancements in graph prompting including</p>
<li>Representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting</li>
<li>Minstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting</li>
<li>Real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains</li>
<li>Open challenges in existing studies with promising future directions in this field</li>
